# BLE_Central

Adapted from the Adafruit example for the Bluefruit NRF52 Feather found here: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_nRF52_Arduino/blob/master/libraries/Bluefruit52Lib/examples/Central/central_bleuart/central_bleuart.ino

Takes input (button press) from central device and sends command to peripheral.  Sends one command for holding down and one for release.
